I am currently pursuing PLANET Europe, an EU-funded double-degree master's programme in planning and environmental policy. With a background in econometrics and data analysis, I am looking for analyst positions in the consulting industry. I believe my skillset would be beneficial to fields such as energy efficiency, environmental advocacy, policy research, etc.
